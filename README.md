# Fun Knowledge User Manual
This web application is a modern approach to transforming how kindergarten students take tests. 

Built to replace traditional paper-based assessments, this web application provides a smooth, stress-free, and tech-friendly testing experience for both students and teachers.

For students, the goal is to make testing engaging, comfortable, and accessible in a digital format. For teachers, the goal is to reduce the hassle of manual grading and test distribution.  

By moving tests online, **Fun & Knowledge** helps familiarize young learners with basic technology skills, allows more students to take tests at once, reduces the workload for educators, and makes the overall process more efficient.
